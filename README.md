# Sjogren's database

Sjogren's database is a registry of patients who have been diagnised with Sjogren's Syndrome. The existing web application can no longer be supported by the oiginal developer as the codebase is outdated. The underlying database is still sound. 


## About

The project is to build a new web client application that links to a database that contains some basic patient contact details. There is an associated (but unlinked) piece of software called MySjogren's Diary which is used by affected individuals to record their symptoms. There is an oportunity to streamline the two separate applications in some way.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Any tools or versions of languages needed to run code. For example specific Python or Node versions. Minimum hardware requirements also go here.

### Installation

How to build or install the applcation.

### Running Locally

How to run the application on your local system.

### Running Tests

How to run tests on your local system.

## Deployment

### Local

Deploying to a production style setup but on the local system. Examples of this would include `venv`, `anaconda`, `Docker` or `minikube`. 

### Production

Deploying to the production system. Examples of this would include cloud, HPC or virtual machine. 

## Usage

Any links to production environment, video demos and screenshots.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Minimum viable product <-- You are Here  
- [ ] Alpha Release  
- [ ] Feature-Complete Release  

## Contributing

### Main Branch
Protected and can only be pushed to via pull requests. Should be considered stable and a representation of production code.

### Dev Branch
Should be considered fragile, code should compile and run but features may be prone to errors.

### Feature Branches
A branch per feature being worked on.
