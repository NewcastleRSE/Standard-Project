# Standard Project
A template repo for the standard RSE project

## >> INITIAL SETUP FOR NEW PROJECTS <<   

When you create a new project, we recommend that you do the following additional manual steps (and then delete this section of the readme).

- Add project details to  this Readme!

- Go to Settings -> Code security and Analysis and enable "Dependabot Version Updates". This will automatically create Pull Requests to keep your dependencies up-to-date. To activate this feature, you will need to specify the package ecosystem (i.e. NPM) and save the YML file. 

- Add a brief description of the project to the 'About' section (top right of this page). If your project involves a website, then add the URL here too.

## Contributing

### Main Branch
Protected and can only be pushed to via pull requests. It should be considered stable and a representation of production code.

### Dev Branch
Should be considered fragile; code should compile and run, but features may be prone to errors.

### Feature Branches
A branch per feature that is being worked on.
